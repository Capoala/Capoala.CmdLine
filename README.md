## Welcome to Capoala.CmdLine!

Capoala.CmdLine is a sophisticated command line utility that allows developers to quickly define, evaluate, and manage, well, the command line!

## Defining a specification. 

The ICommandLineSpecification interface defines the characteristics of a command line argument, such as its delimiter and hierarchal order.

The following sample demenstrates how to create a new specification, where SpecA is a parent-level argument, and SpecB being a child, argument - or decorator - to further define optional paramters.

```csharp
static CommandLineSpecification SpecA = new CommandLineSpecification(0, '/');
static CommandLineSpecification SpecB = new CommandLineSpecification(1, '-');
```
